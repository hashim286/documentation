1. ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
2. find the .ssh folder usually under C:/Users/your_name 
3. scp ./id_rsa.pub destination_username@ip:(destination directory)

4. on host device you can then open id_rsa.pub with notepad and copy the key to the authorized keys file on the destination device with notepad
5. if this doesn't work you can try copying public key to the C:/ProgramData/ssh/administrators_authorized_keys or delete the line at the end of sshd_config that specifies where the administrator keys are
