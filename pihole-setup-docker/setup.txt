1. either do the docker compose or the docker_run script
2. for the docker compose just copy the compose file given under Quick Start section of the pihole docker setup on github here https://github.com/pi-hole/docker-pi-hole#upgrading-persistence-and-customizations
3. for the docker run just wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pi-hole/docker-pi-hole/master/examples/docker_run.sh
4. edit the config file and add your timezone and also remove the tcp/67 for DHCP if you don't need it
5. make sure under FTLCONF_LOCAL_IPV4 you enter your device's private IP address
5. make sure that you save the password that docker gives you because you need it to log into the web interface
6. to change the password just run sudo docker exec -it pihole bash to get into pihole terminal
7. then run pihole -a -p (new password here) and you should see "pihole password changed" or something like that
